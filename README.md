# 3D Model Transformation and Visualization

## Problem Statement

You are given an STL file containing the necessary data to visualize a 3D model. The task is to:

-   Visualize the 3D model represented in the STL file.
-   Perform transformations (scaling and rotation in all directions) on the model when the mouse is clicked.

### Instructions:

1. Read the STL file (provided as a `.txt` file) and extract the necessary data for 3D model visualization.
2. Display the 3D model in an OpenGL window.
3. Implement mouse-click-based transformations (rotation and scaling) on the 3D model.

### Input:

-   A sample input file in `.txt` format representing an STL file.

### Output:

-   A visualized 3D model that responds to mouse clicks with transformations.

## Folder Structure:

-   **Source Code:** Contains the code to visualize and transform the 3D model. The source code should be well-documented, with each function explained clearly.
-   **Sample Input:** The input file in `.txt` format that contains the STL data.
-   **Screenshots:**
    -   A screenshot of the input file.
    -   A screenshot of the 3D model generated from the input file.
-   **Video:** A video demonstrating the 3D model's transformations upon mouse clicks.
